Annoying how jinja stuff or something...takes into account commented out lines!


# What should it do!?

Let users be able to see walks and guides - information about the hill and then link to the walk. 

Can Post comments about the walk if they are logged in.

Create a user and then this should allow a profile which shos them what hills they have climbed/walked.

Can Create their own walks/ add pictures.


Taking the walks from www.where2walk.co.uk as I cant go and do walks in the lakes for a test run.
